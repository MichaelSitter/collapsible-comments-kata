jQuery Kata - Collapsible Comments

Originally designed by Drew Miller
---------------------------------------------------

Do not modify the HTML. Accomplish the following using jQuery or vanilla js.


1. If a comment has more than 128 characters, remove the excess characters and replace them with '...'

2. Replace the '...' with a link to 'Expand' the text to show the full comment

3. Toggle an 'Expand' and 'Collapse' link to show or hide the full comment.

4. Add an expand and collapse animation so that the text appears and hides smoothly

5. Encapsulate this logic as a jQuery plugin
